# Task 1: Search for a number in a list and display its position

# Define a list of integers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]

# Prompt the user to enter a number to search
user_input = int(input("Enter a number to search in the list: "))

# Initialize a flag to track if the number is found
found = False

# Iterate through the list to find the number
for index in range(len(numbers)):
    if numbers[index] == user_input:
        print(f"Number found at position {index}")
        found = True
        break  # Exit the loop once the number is found

# If the number is not found in the list
if not found:
    print("Number not found in the list.")

# Task 2: Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion

# Define a recursive function to calculate factorial
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1  # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)  # Recursive call

# Prompt the user to enter a number to calculate its factorial
num = int(input("\nEnter a number to find its factorial: "))

# Check if the number is negative
if num < 0:
    print("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
else:
    # Calculate and display the factorial
    print(f"Factorial of {num} is {factorial(num)}")
